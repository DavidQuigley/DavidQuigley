<div>We performed integrated analysis of DNA and RNA from 101 metastatic prostate cancer whole genomes. We show an enhancer region affects the Androgen Receptor in approximately 80% of mCRPC and demonstrated how DNA repair defects associated with loss of BRCA2, CDK12, and TP53 are associated with genomic scars of deletions, tandem duplication, and chromothripsis.</div>
